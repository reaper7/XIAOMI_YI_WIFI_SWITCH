XIAOMI YI WIFI MODE SWITCH VIA SHUTTER BUTTON


**this project is deprecated**</br >
**instead please use new one at https://github.com/reaper7/XIAOMI_YI_MODE_SWITCH**

When shutter button is presses when Your Xiaomi Yi camera is starts, 
then wifi are configured as STA mode
(shutter led blinks two times when config done)

If You leave shutter button alone, then cam starts with AP config
(shutter led blinks one when config done)

Please look and edit MISC/TMP.WIFI.CONF and MISC/wpa_supplicant.conf for Your config

Please notice that these scripts do not switch on or off wifi but only prepare configs for them.
You must use WiFi button for on/off wifi!
